# Password Strength Indicator

A simple web application that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, character variety, and common patterns. It provides real-time feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

## Features

- Real-time password strength evaluation based on length:
  - Weak: Less than 6 characters
  - Medium: 6-11 characters
  - Strong: 12 or more characters
- Visual feedback with color-coded strength indicators (red for weak, orange for medium, green for strong)
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Clean, modern UI with a dark theme
- Input field with placeholder and submit button

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for password strength logic and DOM manipulation

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to listen for input events on the password field. As the user types, it evaluates the password length and updates the strength indicator in real-time. The strength is displayed below the input field with appropriate color coding.
